        <h2 class="case-mini-header">THE PROBLEM</h2>

        <h2 class="section-header-text">
            Orzo as a crypto wallet management app is birthed in response to the wide adoption of cryptocurrency — as an
            investment tool and a regular payment method by a rising number of people.
        </h2>

        <p class="probs-section-paragragh">
            A simple research on a number of crypto wallet apps revealed that many of the apps were quite unintuitive
            and difficult to use. It was also evident that most of these apps were targeted towards people who already
            understand crypto. This invariably presents a problem of designing an app that is inclusive and addresses
            important questions such as “how easy is the user able to complete an end to end transaction with the least
            possible steps?”, “are key product features easy to find”? “Compared to other competitors are users able to
            understand what the app does at first glance?” <span class="unique-block">It was also important to
                streamline the intricate process of
                crypto users exchanging one coin to another to get a better return on their investments. Orzo aims to
                address these challenges by simplifying key touchpoints such as onboarding, transaction flows and wallet
                management. With the wide adoption of cryptocurrency and the potential to change the economy and social
                system, simplifying cryptocurrency as an investment tool and payment method in a bid to align with the
                decentralized principle means whatever the outcome is, an elegant and modern design solution that is
                simple,
                yet powerful is expected.</span> <span class="unique-block">This case study seeks to document how I used
                design thinking to arrive at a viable
                design solution that makes trading decisions and long-term app engagements as delightful as
                possible.</span>

        <p class="probs-section-paragragh">
            The design sprint commenced with general competitor research and drafting of proto-personas to help me
            better formulate my understandings. Subsequently I was then able to generate hypothesis and conducted the
            interviews which enabled me to identify several key findings. With my interviews I sought to understand user
            habits regarding using mobile phones to handle financial transactions, what kind of security concerns they
            had regarding their financial institutions and apps that they use, what were their thoughts on the use and
            viability of cryptocurrency? <span class="unique-block">Each interview questions drilled into specific
                behaviors and concerns. Asides
                user interviews I also gained more insight into crypto wallet apps by reading reviews, on Google Play
                and
                iTunes. This was a great way to learn what problems people had with existing products. I had two target
                users for my research; a. Wallet Users: These were users who user crypto apps predominantly for wallet
                activities, and b. Crypto Traders: These were users that use crpto apps for trading and investment.
                During
                the course of the interviews, I spent a bit time asking for their background and establishing what their
                mental model was as well as their expectations. I asked questions such as; what they do with crypto,
                what
                past experiences they've had, how they learnt about crypto, why they are consistent with using it, how
                they
                think existing products could be better and what are the potentials they think could be explored. I
                interviewed 3 women and 4 men, with ages ranging from 18 to 50. Below are highlight of questions from
                the
                interviews:</span>

        <p class="iterate-content">
            At this point I understood what the problem was and what major pain points were. It was now time to come up
            with creative ideas to solve the problem. I like to call my design process a tripartite one - low
            fidelity/wireframing, high fidelity and prototyping which is exactly how I designed for this project. During
            research phase, I learnt that most users preferred to have a multiwallet/portfolio feature so as to keep
            track of their earnings and assets, similar to how bank apps work, I decided to incorporate this into the
            design. <span class="unique-block"> Also for crypto traders, having a built-in exchange feature with
                intergrated charts, graph and other
                trading options will make for a seamless experience, so I decided to explore this idea. My planned
                differentiator was a simple, usable wallet with a robust trading option. Remember the feedback I got
                from
                research: simplicity and security? I wanted to make this app approachable enough for new users - the
                uninitiated so I got inspiration from other wallets, banking apps, pattern libraries and design
                inspiration
                collections to ensure the design was modern and followed current design patterns.</span> <span
                class="unique-block">The final piece was
                putting together all the findings and feedback I had gathered from initial phases. I had set a direction
                for
                the design by establishing information archictecture and general user flow, it was time to do the cool
                stuff
                - create high fidelity designs that can be presented to business owners as well as mirror what the app
                would
                look like in production.</span>

            Based on my findings during the research phase, I learnt how important it was for users to immediately
            understand what the app does as soon as they launch the app for the first time. What better way to do this
            than to explicitly walk new users through a summary of what the app does during the onboarding process. The
            use of bold gradients is in line with brand requirements - to have a compelling powerful feel to show users
            the brand stands out of competition.

            The login and signup screens were designed to be as simple and seamless as possible, with the addition of
            social media login to incentivize users to either create an account or login easily. Because security is of
            immense importance for apps like this, 2FA (two-factor authentication) has been added as an extra layer of
            security to protect users.

            for the home page was designed this way to prevent overloading the user with too much information (my
            knowledge of Human Computer Interaction and Hick’s law sure came in handy while deciding what works and
            not).
