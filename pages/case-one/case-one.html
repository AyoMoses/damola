        <h2 class="case-mini-header">THE PROBLEM</h2>

        <h2 class="section-header-text">
            Orzo as a crypto wallet management app is birthed in response to the wide adoption of cryptocurrency — as an
            investment tool and a regular payment method by a rising number of people.
        </h2>

        <p class="probs-section-paragragh">
            A simple research on a number of crypto wallet apps revealed that many of the apps were quite unintuitive
            and difficult to use. It was also evident that most of these apps were targeted towards people who already
            understand crypto. This invariably presents a problem of designing an app that is inclusive and addresses
            important questions such as “how easy is the user able to complete an end to end transaction with the least
            possible steps?”, “are key product features easy to find”? “Compared to other competitors are users able to
            understand what the app does at first glance?” <span class="unique-block">It was also important to
                streamline the intricate process of
                crypto users exchanging one coin to another to get a better return on their investments. Orzo aims to
                address these challenges by simplifying key touchpoints such as onboarding, transaction flows and wallet
                management. With the wide adoption of cryptocurrency and the potential to change the economy and social
                system, simplifying cryptocurrency as an investment tool and payment method in a bid to align with the
                decentralized principle means whatever the outcome is, an elegant and modern design solution that is
                simple,
                yet powerful is expected.</span> <span class="unique-block">This case study seeks to document how I used
                design thinking to arrive at a viable
                design solution that makes trading decisions and long-term app engagements as delightful as
                possible.</span>
